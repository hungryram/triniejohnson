Hey there, I’m Johana Tamez - a dedicated real estate agent based in beautiful San Antonio, Texas. I’m passionate about my work and devoted to helping you successfully navigate the housing market and discover a home you love.

_Why?_ **If you love where you live, you love your life; and you deserve it.**

Real estate has interested me since a very young age, as well as a deep interest in assisting others. I believe home is truly where the heart is. If we can cultivate a home we love, we can ultimately make the world a better place, even just by starting by showing up in our community.

If you’re ready for a home you love or to sell your current place for your dream space, let’s get started. Please contact me **210.429.6751 johanatamez.realtor@gmail.com.** I’d love to meet you.

XO

Johana T.
