#### **Letter of Recommendation**

Sale of home at 240 W Lullwood, San Antonio, TX 78212 I recently sold a home at 240 W. Lullwood. The home is in the Monte Vista historic neighborhood. I knew that area made my goal of a rapid, “as is” sale more difficult. I needed realtor expertise and assistance. I interviewed six realtors from a variety of reality companies both large and small. This process took four months. I then had the good fortune to meet Pamela “Pam” Flather.

Where the other realtors were helpful, but a little vague on the “how” of selling my Mother’s house, Pam was decisive. A day after our first meeting, she presented a detailed sales plan, area market analysis, a suggested pricing profile and recommended action timeline. I was very impressed with her attention to detail and obvious experience. We signed a contract that resulted in a closed sale, at my requested price, in three weeks.

I found Pam very organized, highly experienced and extremely easy to work with. None of my family lives in San Antonio so we needed a representative with local experience and the energy to drive this sale to a swift resolution. Pam was the perfect fit to our needs. She is very personable with boundless energy and a laser focus on the job we had at hand…selling 240 W. Lullwood. The mission was accomplished in minimum time with zero strain on me. As the customer in this process, I could not be more pleased.

Buying or selling property in the San Antonio…I highly recommend Pam Flather as a gifted realtor who makes things happen.
