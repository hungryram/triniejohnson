### Meet Trinie

Broker, Trinie Ortiz Johnson is a dynamic and devoted real estate professional with nearly a decade of experience in the real estate market. After earning a B.A. in Finance and spending 18 years in the construction industry, Trinie felt it was time to make a change. Initially, she began investing in homes in 2010. She quickly fell in love with the industry and was inspired to earn her real estate license a few short years later in 2013. 

More recently, Trinie received her broker’s license in 2018 and opened 1st Independence Realty in 2020.

Trinie’s enthusiasm, expertise, and dedication to clients quickly put her in line to be a Multi-Million Dollar Producer over the last 4 years in the San Antonio area.

With her bubbly energy and laidback demeanor, the 15 year San Antonio resident embodies the very spirit of the city she calls home.

It may sound like a cliche, but each client becomes like a member of the 1st Independence

family. As a seasoned realtor, Trinie has seen every kind of transaction. Paired with years of customer service experience, she uses her expertise to help clients navigate through any number of special real estate situations including divorce, estate sales, etc.
