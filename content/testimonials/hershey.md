As a first time homebuyer, we were not familiar with the process and the terminology it involved. Trinie helped us through out the whole process. She even recommended a lending agent in the area, which we ended up using and greatly appreciated. Trinie was always responsive and patient even at weekends and late evenings. I truly believe her expertise greatly helped us in our offer getting accepted. I highly recommend Trinie
