Trinie was exceptional in her service taking care of us selling my mother's house. She worked hard and got us a contract in 2 days for full asking price. We had some issues getting to closing because of some unforeseen issues, she was patient and worked well with the buyers. She was great at giving us advice when we needed it. we interviewed two realtors that came highly recommended and it was a tough decisioin to choose between the two. After our positive experience with Trinie we knew we made the right choice.
