My husband and I were recently married and decided we were ready to buy our 1st home together. From the beginning, Trinie made herself available to us when we had questions; and she made great suggestions on homes for us to view in our preferred areas of town. She worked with us in identifying the ideal property to meet our needs. We are now proud owners of an amazing placeâ€¦our home! Thank you so much Trinie for all your help
