testimonial = "Trinie was referred to me by my lender. I was told that we would get along great and she was a wonderful independent agent. Not only did she help me find my home, but she was on top of everything each step of the way. As a first time home buyer I thought I knew what I was looking for, but with her help I was directed in the right path. If you or anyone you know is seriously looking into home buying, I would highly recommend her services. She is knowledgeable in everything within home buying and even after helping me purchase my home she continues to check up on my little family every once in a while. Thank you Trinie!"

We had some issues getting to closing because of some unforeseen issues, she was patient and worked well with the buyers. She was great at giving us advice when we needed it. we interviewed two realtors that came highly recommended and it was a tough decisioin to choose between the two. After our positive experience with Trinie we knew we made the right choice."
