I highly recommend Trinie to anyone selling a house. She ls very knowledgable, professional, friendly, and makes you feel at ease with the stress of selling. She's very hands-on and gives feedback from potential buyers to keep you informed on whats going on. Trinie sold my house and I was very pleased with the outcomme. She was accessible when i called and answered all my questions and concerns in a timely manner. I am confident she can help you too!
