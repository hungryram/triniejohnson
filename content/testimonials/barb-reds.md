Trinie was very helpful and patient during my search for a new home. Finding a home in my price range and move in ready was a challenge. Thanks to Trinie's negotiation skills. My daughter's and I were able to find a home that fit all our needs. The location was perfect and the square footage was perfect for us. I am glad I went with Trinie and would recommend her to anyone looking for a home.
